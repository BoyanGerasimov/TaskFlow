## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

#### UC1: Project Management Workflow
**Actor**: Project Manager  
**Goal**: Create and manage a complete project lifecycle  
**Precondition**: User is authenticated  

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. User creates a new project with name, description, and timeline
2. User sets project status (Not Started/In Progress/Done)
3. User creates tasks within the project
4. User assigns priorities and due dates to tasks
5. User tracks progress by updating task completion status
6. User archives project when completed

**Alternative Flows**:
- If project needs modification, user can edit project details
- If project is cancelled, user can delete project (with confirmation)

#### UC2: Daily Task Management
**Actor**: Team Member  
**Goal**: Manage daily task workflow efficiently  
**Precondition**: User is authenticated and has assigned tasks  

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. User views task list sorted by priority/due date
2. User selects a task to work on
3. User updates task progress and adds notes
4. User marks task as completed when finished
5. User moves to next priority task

**Alternative Flows**:
- If task details need changes, user can edit task information
- If task becomes irrelevant, user can delete task
- If task needs different priority, user can update priority level

#### UC3: User Authentication & Session Management
**Actor**: Any User  
**Goal**: Secure access to personal task management data  
**Precondition**: User has valid account or needs to create one  

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. New user registers with username, email, and password
2. User logs in with credentials
3. System provides JWT token for session management
4. User accesses protected features with active session
5. User logs out to end session

**Alternative Flows**:
- If credentials are invalid, system shows error message
- If session expires, user is redirected to login
- If registration fails, system provides specific error feedback

### Secondary Use Cases

#### UC4: Project Archive Management
**Actor**: Project Manager  
**Goal**: Maintain organized workspace with completed project history  

**Scenario**: User completes a project, marks it as "Done", and accesses it later from the archived projects section for reference.

#### UC5: Multi-device Access
**Actor**: Remote Worker  
**Goal**: Access task management from different devices  

**Scenario**: User logs in from office computer, updates tasks, then later accesses the same data from mobile device or home computer.

#### UC6: Data Persistence & Recovery
**Actor**: Any User  
**Goal**: Ensure work is not lost due to technical issues  

**Scenario**: User's browser crashes or internet disconnects; when reconnecting, all data and progress are preserved.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. **Setup database (required on first run):**
```bash
# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec backend bash -c "cd /app && alembic upgrade head"

# Optional: Seed database with sample data
docker-compose exec backend python seed.py
```

4. **Access the application:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Services Overview
